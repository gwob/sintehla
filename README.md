# Siŋtéȟla
Siŋtéȟla is a version of the Python programming language in Lakhota. It's primary purpose is to simultaneously teach programming and Lakhota language to young people in Lakota language and culture immersion programs. In addition, we hope that this language resource will help create opportunities for Lakhota people to explore language and culture in the context of computer programming. 

This project is the brainchild of Blaze Starkey, founder of the school at the Oceti Sakowin Water Protectors' Camp, with the enthusiastic support of Lisha Sterling of Geeks Without Bounds. A license has not yet been added to this project, as we are not yet certain whether to use a GPL 3.0 license or some compatible license that might better protect the indigenous cultural heritage of this project. 

We are currently in the stage of gathering lists of words that need to be translated. After that, the code will be written as a library of existing Python language. Writing the translations into C code that creates the Python language itself would create a faster language, but it would mean that every time the Python language was updated, we would also have to merge the new code in to our own, creating a massive additional burden on maintainers of this project. Instead, this library should remain more stable from the developer's perspective. 

One long term challenge will be the translation of the documentation for Python into Siŋtéȟla. We will discuss this further in the Wiki.

## Why Siŋtéȟla?
Siŋtéȟla means rattlesnake in Lakota. This is a more regionally appropriate snake name for a Lakhota-based programming language.
